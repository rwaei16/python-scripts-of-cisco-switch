#  network automation of cisco switches 

Automate the configuration of Cisco switches using this Python script.

## Overview

This Python script uses the Paramiko library to automate the configuration of a Cisco switch. It connects to multiple switches via SSH and applies a set of predefined configuration commands.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed - You can install it from the official website - https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
- Paramiko library installed (`pip install paramiko`)
- Connectivity between the switch and the PC which is having the Script of "Cisco Switch configuration file.py" #please read the File of ( basic switch conf.txt file) This file contains the bacis cisco configuration in order to have connectivity between the switch and PC- copy and paste to your Switch 



## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Cisco Switch configuration file
    ```

3. Edit the script (`Cisco Switch configuration file.py`) to update the following variables:

    ```python
    HOST = "10.40.10.28"  # Replace with your Cisco switch IP address
    port = 22  # Replace with your SSH port
    ```

4. Run the script:


- Open CMD if you're using windows Operaitng system or Terminal if you're using Linux 

- Run the follwoing in CMD or Terminal  " python3 Cisco Switch configuration file.py "
    

   The script will prompt you for the SSH username and password, and then connect to the Cisco switch to apply the predefined configuration.

## Configuration Details

The script applies the following configuration to the Cisco switch:

- Configures a banner message of my company test.
- Creates  user account with specific privileges.
- Sets the IP domain name and default gateway.
- Configures trunk mode on the specified interface range.
- Enables password encryption.
- configure VLANS

## Notes

- Insure that the Paramiko library is installed before running the script (`pip install paramiko`).
- Insure that you have connectiviy between the switch and your PC and Vice versa ( make sure to apply the configuration which is in file of basic switch conf.txt into your Switch 
- Customize the script as needed for your specific Cisco switch and network requirements.
- Adjust the script to handle errors or exceptions based on your use case.
